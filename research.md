<br>• **Outline**:
Deeply mining the characteristics of public and market-related data and further evaluate its inner value; 
<br>• **Responsibilities**:  
Researching the impact of market sentiment on the stock market and quantitative analysis of market sentiment using deep learning and other AI models; 
<br>• **Achievement**:  
Published [LEET: stock market forecast with long-term emotional change enhanced temporal model](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1969) in *PeerJ Computer Science, 2024*.( **JCR Q1**, **IF 3.5**) as **First author and corresponding author**.

- [**JP Morgan PTA Project,Quantitative Investment Strategy Development**](https://honglinliao.com//blogs/206yingjian)(Sep 2024 - present)
  <br>**Responsibilities**:  
<br>• Constructed a US tech stock dataset (2019-2024), with 10 years of historical data accessed through the yfinance API. Calculated logarithmic returns, performed volatility modeling, and conducted an asset correlation matrix analysis.

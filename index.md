    Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Robotics and Intelligent Devices at Maynooth University and Fuzhou University. Currently, I hold the position of Research Assistant in the Financial Technology Laboratory. In this role, I have had the privilege of receiving meticulous guidance from Professor Yong Tang, who leads the Data Mining (DM) group within the National Social Science Foundation.
    <br>
   I am actively preparing for and seeking opportunities to pursue a master's degree, with the aim of further advancing my academic journey. Should you have any interest in or inquiries regarding my academic background, research experience, or future plans, I cordially invite you to contact me via email at onglinguge@gmail.com. I would be profoundly grateful for the opportunity to engage in further dialogue with you, sharing insights into my educational experiences and professional aspirations.

## Research Interests and Motivation

- Applied Machine Learning
- Risk Management
- Engineering Management

<ul class="timeline">

My current research primarily focuses on exploring<strong> the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the fields of economics and engineering management</strong>. This study is dedicated to organically integrating the macroscopic perspective of economics with the meticulous operations of engineering management into the architectural design and training processes of AI models. The exceptional capabilities of AI in processing vast amounts of data, recognizing complex patterns, and making real-time decisions offer unprecedented opportunities for creating more resilient, efficient, and secure management systems.
<br>This interdisciplinary integration not only holds the promise of significantly enhancing AI performance in system management but also has the potential to make substantial contributions to the efficient, stable, and orderly functioning of society and the world at large. By synthesizing the strengths of these diverse fields, I aim to develop innovative solutions capable of addressing the complex challenges of modern society, thereby advancing management science and technology, and ultimately contributing to the enhancement of human well-being.
<br>Through this research, I aspire to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications, leveraging AI's computational power to tackle intricate economic and managerial problems. The goal is to create adaptive and intelligent systems that can navigate the complexities of global markets, optimize resource allocation, and improve decision-making processes across various sectors. This work not only pushes the boundaries of AI applications but also seeks to establish a new paradigm in interdisciplinary research, fostering collaboration between traditionally distinct academic domains for the betterment of society.
